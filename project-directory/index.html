  <h1>Diane Stephani</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Diane and I was born in Michigan City, IN. I graduated from Indiana University with a BA in Communications. I moved to Seattle in 2014 and have worked here in the service industry ever since. Recently I became a NASM-certified personal trainer. My other work experience includes high-end retail, translation and interpreting, and I'm a published writer in several Seattle magazines. I hope to get a tech job at a big campus like Microsoft, for a fashion company like Nordstrom or Gucci, or for lifestyle magazines at Hearst or Conde Nast.</p>
